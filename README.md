# MMM-TouchNavigation

This an extension for the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://magicmirror.builders/).
This Module adds a touch menu to switch between different profiles from the [MMM-ProfileSwitcher].

## Installation

Since I made this module to work in conjunction with the [MMM-ProfileSwitcher] you will have to install this module first.
You can read more information about how to install it on it's github page.

**Note:** it is also possible to use this module in conjunction with other modules since it only uses notifications,
if a module supports this navigation is up to the maker. More information about this in [Notes For Other Developers](#notes-for-other-developers).

After installing the [MMM-ProfileSwitcher].

In your terminal, go to your MagicMirror's Module folder:
````
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
````

Clone this repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/tosti007/MMM-TouchNavigation.git
````

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
    {
        module: 'MMM-TouchNavigation',
        config: {
            // See 'Configuration options' for more information.
        }
    }
]
````

## Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:

| Option            | Description
| ----------------- | -----------
| `showBorder`      | Determines if the border around the buttons should be shown. <br><br> **Possible values:** `true` or `false` <br> **Default value:** `true`
| `minWidth`        | The minimum width for all the buttons. <br><br> **Possible values:** `css length` <br> **Default value:** `0px`
| `minHeight`       | The minimum height for all the buttons. <br><br> **Possible values:** `css length` <br> **Default value:** `0px`
| `symbolPlacement` | The location of the symbol relative to the text. <br><br> **Possible values:** `left`, `right`, `top` or `bottom` <br> **Default value:** `left`
| `direction`       | The direction of the menu. <br><br> **Possible values:** `row`, `column`, `row-reverse` or `column-reverse`<br> **Default value:** `row`
| `buttons`         | All the different buttons in the menu. <br><br> **Possible values:** a button configuration, see [Configuring Buttons](#configuring-buttons) <br> **Default value:** some example buttons


## Configuring Buttons
Buttons have to be placed in `buttons` in the `config`. A button contains a profile name as key and a configuration in an object (`{}`).

| Option   | Description
| -------- | -----------
| `text`   | A string to display in the button. <br><br> **Note:** if no value is set no text will be displayed. <br> **Possible values:** `string`
| `symbol` | A symbol to display in the button. <br><br> **Note:** if no value is set no symbol will be displayed. <br> **Possible values:** See [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) website

An example:
````javascript
buttons: {
    "profile_name": { 
        // A button with text and a symbol
        text: "text to display",
        symbol: "ban"
    },
    "example1": {
        // A button with only a symbol
        symbol: "paper-plane"
    },
    "example2": {
        // A button with only text
        text: "Click me"  
    }
}
````

## An Example Module Configuration
An example configuration file has been added to this repository, file `example-config.js`.

## Notes
* **Important:** unfortunatly positioning this module as fullscreen will result in the menu floating top left. I currently do not know how to fix this but will look into it. If you know how don't hesitate to either write me or send me a pull request!
* Profile name is case sensitive.
* If both the `text` and `symbol` aren't set for a button then the button won't contain anything, but still show the border.
* The symbols are all form the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) website.
* The text may contain HTML tags and will be displayed as HTML.

## Notes For Other Developers
* When a button is pressed a `CURRENT_PROFILE` notification will be send.
* When a `CHANGED_PROFILE` notification is received the menu dom will be updated.
